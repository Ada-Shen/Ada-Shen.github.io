My name is Wen Shen. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Tongji University. Before that, I received the B.S. degree in information security at the Tongji University, China, in 2016.

Research Interests
======
My research interests range across computer vision, machine learning, 3D point cloud processing, and explainable AI.
