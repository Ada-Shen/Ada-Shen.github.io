I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I received the Ph.D. degree in 	Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, China, in 2022.

Research Interests
======
My research interests range across computer vision, machine learning, 3D point cloud processing, and explainable AI.
